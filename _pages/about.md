## About Me
I am Yang Ji, a PhD student in Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) (HKUST-GZ), under the supervision of Prof. Sun Ying. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and a Master's degree from Hong Kong Baptist University, where I worked under Prof. Jianliang Xu.

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in machine learning, data mining, and data security. I focus on verifiable query systems and security issues in decentralized systems, particularly blockchains enabled by trusted hardware such as Intel SGX. I aim to address real-world challenges in data science through innovative research.
